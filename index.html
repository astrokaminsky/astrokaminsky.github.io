      Hello! My name is Aidan Kaminsky and I am currently a PhD candidate 
      at the University of Miami. I work under the supervision of Dr. Nico Cappelluti, where I 
      study the anisotropies of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). The CIB is the integrated emission 
      from star formation, black hole accretion, and other luminous activities occurring from early times until today. 
      Understanding the spatial distribution of galaxies hidden in the CIB provides insights into their co-evolution in large-scale structures.

      This page is dedicated to my past and ongoing research projects, as well as computational side projects that others may find interesting. Enjoy!
