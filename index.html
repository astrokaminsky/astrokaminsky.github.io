      Hello! My name is Aidan Kaminsky and I am currently a PhD candidate 
      at the University of Miami. I work under the supervision of Dr. Nico Cappelluti, where I 
      study the anisotropies of the Cosmic Infrared Background, or CIB. The CIB is the integrated emission 
      from star formation, black hole accretion, and other luminous activities 
      occuring from early times until the present today. Understanding the spatial distribution of galaxies hidden in the 
      CIB provide insights as to how they affect and co-evolve in their large-scale structures. To investigate these physics I use 
      theoretical models and data from the James Webb Space Telescope, Spitzer, and Chandra. Before beginning my PhD work, I spent a year 
      studying under Postdoctoral fellow Lars Bonne at the SOFIA Science Center, where I modelled the dynamics of the Musca filamentary cloud, a pristine string-like structure 
      in the interstellar medium that is early in its gravitational fragmentation. While these projects seem (and are!) very different, the connection lies in the physics of star formation. 
      What physics processes drive the evolution of star formation? How do large-scale structures, supermassive black hole feedback, etc. affect such processes? 
      How did the physics of star formation look like in the early Universe? These are all questions that I am interested in addressing. This page is dedicated to past and on-going projects as well 
      as computational side-projects that others may be interested in. Enjoy!
