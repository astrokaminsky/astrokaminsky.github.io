      <h3><strong>On the 3D Curvature and Dynamics of the Musca Filament</strong>:
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/acc462" target="_blank">DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/acc462</a>

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Filaments are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, yet their formation and evolution remain the topic of intense debate. In order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the 3D morphology and evolution of the Musca filament, we model the C18O(2-1) emission along the filament crest with several large-scale velocity field structures. This indicates that Musca is well described by a 3D curved cylindrical filament with longitudinal mass inflow to its center unless the filament is a transient structure with a lifetime ≲0.1 Myr. Gravitational longitudinal collapse models of filaments appear unable to explain the observed velocity field. To better understand these kinematics, we further analyze a map of the C18O(2-1) velocity field at the location of SOFIA HAWC+ dust polarization observations that trace the magnetic field in the filament. This unveils an organized magnetic field that is oriented roughly perpendicular to the filament crest. Although the velocity field is also organized, it progressively changes its orientation by more than 90° when laterally crossing the filament crest and thus appears disconnected from the magnetic field in the filament. This strong lateral change of the velocity field over the filament remains unexplained and might be associated with important longitudinal motion that can be associated to the large-scale kinematics along the filament.</p>

      <h3><strong>Tracing high-z Galaxies in X-rays with JWST and Chandra</strong>:

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z > 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 < z < 13. In our high-z (6 < z < 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2σ with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.</p>
